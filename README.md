# Attendance_system
Attendance Management System with Image Capture

# Objective
Develop a web application that allows a manager to create a roster for staff. Staff members should 
be able to mark their attendance by capturing their image using the webcam on a site-available 
laptop.

## Backend Requirements:
- Authentication & Authorization:
- Implement roles: Manager and Staff. Only authenticated managers can create/edit/view the roster. Only authenticated staff can mark their attendance.
- Roster Management:
- Managers should be able to Add new staff members to the roster. Set working days and shifts for each staff member, allowing different shifts for different days of the  week. Set 1-2 weekly offs per staff member. View the complete roster. Edit the details of any staff member in the roster.
- Staff members should be able to: Interchange their shifts among themselves.
### Attendance Management:
- Staff members should be able to: View their assigned shifts. Mark their attendance by capturing an image using the webcam, but only within 1 hour of their shift  timings. The system should store the attendance data, timestamp, and the captured image.
